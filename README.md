# AFSLib
AFSLib is a library that can extract, create and manipulate AFS files. The AFS format is used in many games from companies like Sega. Even though it's a simple format, there are lots of quirks and edge cases in many games that require implementing specific fixes or workarounds for the library to work with them. If you encounter any issue with a specific game, don't hesitate to report it.

For a usage example, you can check [AFSPacker](https://github.com/MaikelChan/AFSPacker), a simple command line tool that uses AFSLib to extract and create AFS files.
