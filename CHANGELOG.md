## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2021-09-06
### Added
- Entry block alignment is now configurable.
- AFS constructor now accepts a file path.
- Added method to add all files in a directory and, optionally, its subdirectories.
- Added a method to save directly to a file.
- AddEntry* methods now return a reference to the added entry.
- Implemented null entries. They are created with NullEntry, and fixed all issues related to not being able to remove them or add them.

### Changed
- AFS class is now IDisposable. Dispose needs to be called to close the internal FileStream in case the AFS object is created from a file.
- When adding an entry, null entry names are considered as string.Empty.
- Improved XML documentation.
- Renamed Name to SanitizedName and RawName to Name. This makes more sense because Name is the actual name of an entry, and SanitizedName is the autogenerated read-only name that contains no invalid characters.
- UnknownAttribute and LastWriteTime properties are now modifiable.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated AddEntry, ExtractEntry and ExtractAllEntries. Now they are called AddEntryFromFile, AddEntryFromStream, ExtractEntryToFile, ExtractAllEntriesToDirectory.
- In an entry, Rename has been deprecated. Use the Name property instead.
- In an entry, Unknown property has been deprecated. Use the UnknownAttribute property instead.

### Fixed
- Make sure an entry name cannot be longer than 32 characters.

## [1.0.1] - 2021-09-01
### Added
- Be able to add an entry from a Stream to an AFS file.
### Fixed

## [1.0.0] - 2021-09-01
